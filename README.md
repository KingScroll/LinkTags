# LinkTag
 > The LinkTag Tool is a simple quality of life utility that makes tagging people far easier in html pages
 
 The idea behind LinkTag is to give anyone and everyone with an HTML page the ability to tag users without having to create an HTML <a> tag.
 
 For example, say you want to tag Selena Gomez while writing. If you were on Twitter or Instagram, you could simply tag her like so: @selenagomez.
 
 But you can't tag her as simply on a blog. You'd need to type this: 
 
		<a href = "https://linktr.ee/selenagomez/" target = "_blank"> @selenagomez </a>

But with LinkTag, you can just write __@selenagomez__ and call it a day!

But say you want to tag her Instagram instead of her Linktree, how do you do  that?

Easily.

__@selenagomez:instagram__

will output:

	<a href = "https://instagram.com/selenagomez/" target = "_blank"> @selenagomez </a>
